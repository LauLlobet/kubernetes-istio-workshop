= Setup Kubernetes Cluster
include::_attributes.adoc[]

[#summary]
== Summary
In this lab, you will create a new Kubernetes cluster, which we'll use for the rest of the lab.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites
- Use either **Google Cloud Shell** or your terminal with Google Cloud SDK installed (the SDK comes with ``kubectl``, so you do not need to install it manually)
- You already created a GCP project and set the ``$PROJECT_ID`` envrionement variable.
- You already cloned the directory : ``https://github.com/Sfeir/kubernetes-istio-workshop``.

Run the following commands to configure ``gcloud``, this will save you from typing the parameters ``$PROJECT_ID``, ``zone`` or ``region`` in every ``gcloud`` command.

[source, bash]
----
gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b
gcloud config set compute/region europe-west1
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
- All the commands must be run in the ``kubernetes-istio-workshop`` directory.
====


[#create-cluster]
== Create the cluster

Create a cluster:

[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud beta container clusters create "istio-workshop"

kubeconfig entry generated for istio-workshop.
NAME            LOCATION        MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION  NUM_NODES  STATUS
istio-workshop  europe-west1-b  1.13.7-gke.8    35.240.33.159  n1-standard-1  1.13.7-gke.8  3          RUNNING
----

⏳ Wait until the cluster is created. It may takes up to 5 minues.

[#connect-cluster]
== Connect to the cluster
Let's check the connexion to our newly created cluster:

1- Review the cluster's informations:

[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud container clusters list

NAME           LOCATION        MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION  NUM_NODES  STATUS
istio-cluster  europe-west1-b  1.9.7-gke.6     35.195.237.45  n1-standard-1  1.9.7-gke.6   3          RUNNING
----

2- Download the cluster's credentials, they will be written to ``kubectl``'s configuration file (``~/.kube/config```).

[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials istio-workshop

Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for istio-workshop.
----

3- Check the connexion with the cluster:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl cluster-info

Kubernetes master is running at https://35.184.85.239
GLBCDefaultBackend is running at https://35.184.85.239/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/default-http-backend:http/proxy
Heapster is running at https://35.184.85.239/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
KubeDNS is running at https://35.184.85.239/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
Metrics-server is running at https://35.184.85.239/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:metrics-server:/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Now you are ready to install Istio!
