= Monitoring and Tracing
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In addition to the core components, Istio installation includes a collection of optional monitoring and tracing services, these tools are:

- **Prometheus**: for collecting and querying monitoring and metrics data.
- **Grafana**: for visualizing monitoring and metrics data from Prometheus.
- **Jaeger**: for distributed tracing to track every request through mesh allowing a deeper understanding about request latency, serialization and parallelism.
- **Kiali**: for visualizing different aspects of your mesh, this includes viewing *service graph* and *traffic flow* and your Istio *configuration files*.

Examine the Istio running services and notice the presence of the following services : ``prometheus``,``grafana``, ``jaeger-query`` and ``kiali``.

== Making dashboards publicly available

For the sake of simplicity we will expose publicly the four dashboards to avoid you using a complicated ``kubectl port-forward`` command. The dashboards are exposed in the same way as we exposed the ``customer`` service with the help of a ``Gateway`` and a ``VirtualService``.


[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f src/install/1.2.5/dashboards
----

== Load generation

Before looking at metrics, it is helpful to generate a load on the application. For this lab, we will generate a load for 5 minutes using the istio/fortio image.

[source,bash]
----
docker run istio/fortio load -t 5m -qps 5 $customer
----

[#grafana]
== Vizualizing Metrics with Grafana

The Grafana's address is: http://$GATEWAY_URL:15031/

To display the Istio dashboard, replace the path of the URL by ``/dashboard/db/istio-workload-dashboard``. The URL should look like:

[source]
----
http://$GATEWAY_URL:15031/dashboard/db/istio-workload-dashboard
----

Examine the dashboard, you should see some statistics for the requests you sent earlier.

[#prometheus]
== Querying Metrics from Prometheus

The URL for Prometheus is: http://$GATEWAY_URL:15030/

The Prometheus console should look like this.

image:prometheus1.png[alt text]

Let's enter a query to display the total requests sent to the ``recommendation`` service:

Enter:

[source]
----
istio_requests_total{destination_service="recommendation.workshop.svc.cluster.local"}
----

select `Execute` and click on the *Graph* tab to display the graph corresponding to the load generation query.

NOTE: You may have to refresh the browser for the Prometheus graph to update.

[#jaeger]
== Vizualizing Tracing with Jaeger

Jaeger's URL is: http://$GATEWAY_URL:15032

- You should see the trace statistics.
