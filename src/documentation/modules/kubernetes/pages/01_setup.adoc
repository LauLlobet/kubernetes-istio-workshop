= Getting started with Kubernetes
include::_attributes.adoc[]

== Summary

Kubernetes is all about applications and in this section you will utilize the Kubernetes API to deploy, manage, and upgrade applications. In this part of the workshop you will use an example application called "app" to complete the chapters.

https://github.com/kelseyhightower/app[App] is hosted on GitHub and provides an example 12 Facter application. During this workshop you will be working with the following Docker images:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/kelseyhightower/monolith[kelseyhightower/monolith] - Monolith includes auth and hello services.
* https://hub.docker.com/r/kelseyhightower/auth[kelseyhightower/auth] - Auth microservice. Generates JWT tokens for authenticated users.
* https://hub.docker.com/r/kelseyhightower/monolith[kelseyhightower/hello] - Hello microservice. Greets authenticated users.
* https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx[nginx] - Frontend to the auth and hello services.

== Create Kubernetes cluster on GKE

You'll create a Kubernetes cluster using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) web UI.

Click the 3 bar menu - aka. the __Burger__ - on the upper-left corner of the GCP Console.

When you mouse over the menu item __Kubernetes Engine__, a pin appear on the right. Click it to pin __Kubernetes Engine__ on top of the menu. You can do the same with __Compute Engine__ and __Container Registry__.

Then click on __Kubernetes Engine__ to open the list of GKE clusters.

You don't have any cluster now. Click the __Create cluster__ button to open the cluster creation wizard.

On the left column, choose the cluster template named "Standard cluster".

On the right part of the wizard:

* Give your cluster the name *kube-cluster*
* Let `Zonal` for the Location type
* Choose `europe-west1-b` as Zone for this cluster (to have it close to the user)
* Let the default value for the master version
* In the default-pool, keep 3 nodes but choose `n1-standard-2` as machine type
* Click the __Create__ button to create the cluster

‚è≥ Wait until the cluster is fully started. It should takes 2-3 minutes.

You can also follow cluster creation from the Cloud Shell
```shell
gcloud container clusters list
```

You should see your cluster with some details
```shell
NAME          LOCATION        MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION   NUM_NODES  STATUS
kube-cluster  europe-west1-b  1.13.10-gke.0   34.65.193.222  n1-standard-2  1.13.10-gke.0  3          PROVISIONING
```

Run Look at *STATUS* column which should evolve from `PROVISIONING` to `RUNNING`
```shell
NAME          LOCATION        MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION   NUM_NODES  STATUS
kube-cluster  europe-west1-b  1.13.10-gke.0   34.65.193.222  n1-standard-2  1.13.10-gke.0  3          RUNNING
```


== Configure Kubernetes command-line client

`kubectl` is the command-line client for Kubernetes. It's a user interface calling the Kubernetes REST API's on the Master IP address.

You can verify the API with `curl`, replace `[MASTER_IP]` by the MASTER_IP of your cluster above
```shell
curl -k https://[MASTER_IP]/
```
On Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), the master API is authenticated and reject anonymous connections with HTTP code 403:
```json
{
    "kind": "Status",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": { },
    "status": "Failure",
    "message": "forbidden: User \"system:anonymous\" cannot get path \"/\"",
    "reason": "Forbidden",
    "details": {},
    "code": 403
}
```

To call the master API, you'll create a configuration for `kubectl` on your Cloud Shell.
```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials kube-cluster --zone=europe-west1-b
```

You can now list the nodes composing your cluster and see what is running inside it
```shell
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get all
```

You have 3 nodes and a single service running in Kubernetes.
This `service/kubernetes` resource is a service exposing the REST API of your Kubernetes cluster to the Pods, allowing them to execute `kubectl` commands if they want to (very few applications do that) or call API programmatically (it's more common).

You can also load kubectl auto-competion for current bash shell
```shell
source <(kubectl completion bash)
```
You have to do it on each new shell or add it on your bash profile.

That way, you'll be able to list kubectl commands and arguments with :
```shell
kubectl <Tab><Tab>
```
or
```shell
kubectl get p<Tab><Tab>
```
