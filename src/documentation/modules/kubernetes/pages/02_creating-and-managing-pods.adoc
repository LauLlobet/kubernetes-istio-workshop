= Creating and managing pods
include::_attributes.adoc[]

At the core of Kubernetes is the Pod. Pods represent a logical application and hold a collection of one or more containers and volumes running on the same node. In this chapter you will learn how to:

* Write a Pod configuration file
* Create and inspect Pods
* Interact with Pods remotely using kubectl

In this chapter you will create a Pod named `monolith` and interact with it using the kubectl command line tool.

== Tutorial: Creating Pods

Let's look at configuration file used to create Kubernetes resources.
To see files on your free instance, Cloud Shell provides a code editor.
Open it using the pencil button

Now explore the `monolith` pod configuration file in `kubernetes-istio-workshop/manifests/app/pods/monolith.yaml`

Notice some important parts of this Pod definition:

* you can have more than one container per pod
* each container have its own image and arguments, and can declare which ports its listen to
* you should define requests and limits for your container
** requests specifies minimal resources required by you application
** limits will protect your cluster for uncontrolled resource consumption by containers

To deploy the `monolith` pod, use kubectl to _apply_ your pod definition on the cluster :
```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/app/pods/monolith.yaml
```

== Exercise: View Pod details

Use the `kubectl get` and `kubect describe` commands to view details for the `monolith` Pod.

You can also navigate on the _Workloads_ menu in GCP console

=== Hints

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

```shell
kubectl describe pods <pod-name>
```

=== Quiz

* What is the IP address of the `monolith` Pod?
* What node is the `monolith` Pod running on?
* What containers are running in the `monolith` Pod?
* What are the labels attached to the `monolith` Pod?
* What arguments are set on the `monolith` container?

== Exercise: Interact with a Pod remotely

Pods are allocated a private IP address by default and cannot be reached outside of the cluster. Use the `kubectl port-forward` command to map a local port to a port inside the `monolith` pod. 

=== Hints

Use two Cloud Shell terminals. One to run the `kubectl port-forward` command, and the other to issue `curl` commands.

```shell
kubectl port-forward monolith 10080:80
```

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:10080
curl http://127.0.0.1:10080/secure
TOKEN=$( curl -s -u user:password http://127.0.0.1:10080/login | jq -r .token )
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" http://127.0.0.1:10080/secure
```

== Exercise: View the logs of a Pod

Use the `kubectl logs` command to view the logs for the `monolith` Pod:

```shell
kubectl logs monolith
```

> Use the -f flag and observe what happens.

=== Bonus: download and use `stern` for logs

Stern (https://github.com/wercker/stern) is a small go binary which allow to follow logs from multiple pods by pod-name patterns.

Download it from github and make it executable
```shell
curl -L -o stern https://github.com/wercker/stern/releases/download/1.11.0/stern_linux_amd64
chmod +x stern
```

Then you can get logs from pods by pattern:
```shell
./stern monoli*
```

== Exercise: Run an interactive shell inside a Pod

Use the `kubectl exec` command to run an interactive shell inside the `monolith` Pod:

```shell
kubectl exec monolith --stdin --tty -c monolith /bin/sh
```

List all process running inside this pod:
```shell
ps aux
```
