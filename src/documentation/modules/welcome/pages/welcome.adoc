[#gcp]
== Google Cloud Platform

In this workshop we will be using https://cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)].
GCP provides both a managed Kubernetes cluster: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/[Google Kubernetes Engine],
and a hosted command line environment: https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/[Google Cloud Shell].

Cloud Shell is a Debian-based virtual machine is provisionned with all the
development tools you'll need (Kubernetes, Docker, Python, Java, Node, etc.).
It offers a persistent 5GB home directory.
